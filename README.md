This is a solid foundation for a portfolio-grade GitHub repository. Your notebook demonstrates strong feature engineering—particularly the use of cyclical encoding and exponential moving averages (EMAs)—which clearly paid off given the low RMSE scores.

Here is a comprehensive README.md file tailored to your project.

Stock Volatility Prediction using Gradient Boosting & Ensemble Methods

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting future stock market volatility using a combination of historical trading data and quarterly financial metrics. By leveraging advanced feature engineering—such as cyclical time encoding and volatility clustering captures (EMA/SMA)—this assessment compares the performance of three powerful regression models: LightGBM, CatBoost, and Random Forest.

The objective is to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on a hold-out validation set that simulates real-world temporal forecasting.
